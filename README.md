# Open Data Management System

ODMS (Open Data Management System) is a web-based application that covers the complete data life cycle. The application is designed to help users manage, visualize and analyze datasets.

## Backend:

- The Django web framework is used as the primary backend technology.
- Django REST Framework is used to quickly create an API that allows the application to communicate with the frontend.
- PostgresQL is used as a database management system to store and manage the data.

## Frontend:

- Vanilla JavaScript is used to create the user interface.
- Chart.js library is used to visualize data in the form of graphs and charts.

## Functionalities:

- The application allows users to create various datasets and files in them.
- Data can be presented in the form of graphs and tables.
- Site search feature allows users to quickly find the data they need.
- Authentication is implemented to restrict access to certain parts of the application.
- A system of roles and permissions is implemented to control user access to certain features.

## Development:

- OOP principles were used to develop the structure and organization of the application.
- Asynchronous requests are used to communicate with the server from the client side.
- Data is accessed and manipulated using the ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) feature of Django.
- An API is created to allow external systems to access and manipulate data stored in the application.
- Overall, ODMS is a powerful and flexible data management tool that allows users to easily create, manage, and analyze datasets. The application's use of modern web technologies and frameworks, such as Django and JavaScript, ensures that it is robust, scalable, and easy to maintain. The implementation of features like data visualization, search, and user management provides users with the tools they need to effectively analyze and make decisions based on their data. Additionally, the use of an API allows for easy integration with other systems and applications, further increasing the application's utility.

**It's important to note that the application is continuously improving and being updated with new features to ensure better performance, security and user experience. The development team is constantly monitoring and testing the application to ensure that it is operating efficiently and effectively.**

In summary, ODMS is a comprehensive data management system that provides users with the ability to create, manage, and analyze datasets in an easy-to-use and powerful way. The application's use of modern technologies and frameworks, combined with its rich set of features, makes it an invaluable tool for any organization or individual that works with large amounts of data.
